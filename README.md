docker-react-symfony
==============

Forked from [https://github.com/eko/docker-symfony](https://github.com/eko/docker-symfony)

I changed a few things in order to make the docker setting fit my personal needs.

These include:

* Remove the ELK stack
* Structure the files in a different way
* Add a container for react
* Add a basic file setup for react and symfony
